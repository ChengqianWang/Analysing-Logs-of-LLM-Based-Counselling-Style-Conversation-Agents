      "Start Hi! I'm MIcha, your motivational chatbot. My goal is to help you reflect on your behavior and help you develop a plan for your behavioral change. Please think carefully about my questions and see them primarily as thought impulses that bring you mentally closer to your goal. I'm not here to give you tips or recommendations for action, but to get clear about your motives and values. What behavioral change do you want to talk about today? I want to procrastinate less So you want to procrastinate less. Can you tell me something about why this change is important to you? I could be a lot further in my life. How important is this change on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very) I don't know. On a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very), how interested are you in doing this change right now? 8 An 8. So you're positive about this change overall. Can you tell me a little more about this assessment? Why didn't you give a higher or lower value? Because I have to change something now, but I've told myself that many times, so only eight. That sounds like you've often felt the impulse to change something, but then you haven't. What prevents you from putting the desired change into action? Everyday life, laziness. It seems as if everyday life and laziness are obstacles for you. How could it be if you overcome these obstacles? That would be very nice and an improvement in my living quality. It sounds like you want a higher quality of life and think that less procrastination could contribute to it. Are there other aspects you want to improve if you procrastinate less? Spend more time with friends and family. So you would like to spend more time with your loved ones if you were to procrastinate less. How much do you think this change would help to spend more time with friends and family? Think very strongly, since I spend a lot of time with Daddelei. So you strongly believe that less procrastination would give you more time with your friends and family, as you spend a lot of time with \"daddy\" right now. You feel ready for a change and you feel that you have to change something now, even though you've told yourself that many times. You admit that everyday life and laziness are obstacles to you, but you also see the potential for an improved quality of life and more time with the people you care about. Have I forgotten something yet? Nope. Please tell me again what your next step will be concrete. I thought you'd tell me. Thank you for your openness in our conversation. I hope it helped you at least to get a little closer to your goal.\n"
